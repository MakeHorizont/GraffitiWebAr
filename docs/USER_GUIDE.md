## Introduction

Vestigium is a decentralized augmented reality platform that allows you to leave digital "traces" in the real world. These traces can be text, images, or even 3D models, and they are tied to specific geographic locations. Other users can then discover your traces by exploring the world through the Vestigium app.

## The Main Menu

When you first open the application, you'll be greeted by the main menu. From here, you can start the AR experience, manage your account, and access other resources.

### Starting the Experience

To begin exploring the world in augmented reality, you'll first need to select an account mode.

*   **Guest Mode:** If you just want to look around and see what others have created, select "Guest Mode." You won't be able to create your own content, but you can view all public traces.
*   **Create Account/Login:** To create your own traces, you'll need an account. You can either create a new one or log in with an existing one.

Once you've selected your mode, the "Start" button will become active. Press it to enter the AR experience.

### Account Management

The "Create Account" button on the main menu allows you to manage your decentralized identity (DID).

*   **Create Account (File-Key):** This option will generate a new DID for you and save it as a file on your device. Keep this file safe, as it's the key to your account.
*   **Login with File:** If you have an existing account file, you can use this option to log in.

### Settings

The "Settings" button will take you to a menu where you can configure your application preferences. (This feature is still under development.)

### Instructions

The "Instructions" button will open this user guide in a new tab.

### Project Links

The "Project Links" button will take you to a page with links to other projects by the "Ten Tools of the New World" organization.

## The AR Experience

Once you've started the AR experience, your phone's camera will activate, and you'll see the world through your screen, augmented with digital content.

### Navigating the AR View

The AR interface is designed to be intuitive and unobtrusive.

*   **Main View:** The majority of the screen is dedicated to the camera view, so you can see the world around you.
*   **UI Elements:** Buttons and menus are located at the bottom of the screen for easy access.

### Interacting with Content

As you move around, you may see digital objects appear in the world.

*   **Selection:** To interact with an object, simply tap on it. A wireframe will appear around the object to indicate that it's selected.
*   **Manipulation:** Once an object is selected, you can move, rotate, and scale it using touch gestures. (This feature is still under development.)

### Creating Your Own Content

To leave your own trace in the world, follow these steps:

1.  **Open the Object Menu:** Tap the "Select Object" button at the bottom of the screen.
2.  **Choose a Content Type:** Select the type of content you want to create (e.g., text, image, 3D model).
3.  **Add Your Content:** Follow the prompts to add your content. For example, you might be asked to type some text or select an image from your device.
4.  **Place the Object:** Once your content is ready, you can place it in the world by tapping on a surface.

Thank you for using Vestigium! We hope you enjoy exploring and creating in the world of decentralized augmented reality.
