# It should be expanded with the actual setup logic.

# 1. Configure Prometheus to send alerts to Alertmanager
# 2. Configure Alertmanager to send notifications to a chosen channel (e.g., email, Slack, PagerDuty)
# 3. Define alert rules for critical events (e.g., node down, high CPU usage, low disk space)
