# След / Vestigium / 迹 (Jì)

**A decentralized augmented reality platform for leaving and discovering digital traces in the real world.**

Vestigium is a WebAR application that allows users to place digital content (text, images, 3D models) at specific geographic locations. This content can then be discovered by other users through the AR interface. The platform is built on decentralized technologies like IPFS and OrbitDB, ensuring that the data is censorship-resistant and user-owned.

## Features

*   **Decentralized:** All content is stored on IPFS and OrbitDB, giving users full control over their data.
*   **Augmented Reality:** Discover and place digital content in the real world through your smartphone's camera.
*   **Geolocation:** Content is tied to specific geographic coordinates, creating a location-based experience.
*   **Cross-Platform:** As a web application, Vestigium runs on any modern smartphone with a web browser and camera access.
*   **User-Friendly Interface:** A clean, responsive, and intuitive interface designed for a seamless user experience.

## Getting Started

2.  **Choose your mode:**
    *   **Guest Mode:** Explore public content without creating an account.
    *   **Create Account:** Generate a new decentralized identity (DID) to create and manage your own content.
    *   **Login:** Restore your existing identity.
3.  **Start Exploring:** Press the "Start" button to enter the AR mode.
4.  **Discover Content:** Move your phone around to find digital traces left by other users.
